Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don\u2019t collapse when depressurized on the ground.","119":"Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4.","120":"A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps & pressure-stabilize\/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls","121":"Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight.

If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit.","2933":"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power.","2934":"Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)","2935":"Walking speed is around 5km\/h, but if you\u2019re in an air tube, time doesn\u2019t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.","2936":"Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.","2937":"Exactly.

On other hand, Ford, Chrysler & GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article \u2026","3326":"No problem","3327":"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet.","3328":"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!","3329":"I didn\u2019t meet with him","3330":"I definitely don\u2019t do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can\u2019t be creative otherwise.","3331":"Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.","3332":"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body\/chassis weight front, he wasn\u2019t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars.","3333":"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced.","3334":"To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today\u2019s Model S is far more refined than initial production.","3335":"ABS calibration algorithm","3336":"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise & many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.","3337":"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won\u2019t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.","3338":"Stop, you\u2019re making me blush \u263a\ufe0f","3339":"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little","3340":"Complexity is the devil. Words can\u2019t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp & trying to get to profitability. But we\u2019ll try.","3341":"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations.","3342":"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3\u2019s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we\u2019ve seen anything like this.","3343":"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3\u2019s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers","3344":"Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance & others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out & address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.","3345":"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers & beeping forklifts you said didn\u2019t exist.

Super love working with her.","3347":"\u2665\ufe0f\ud83e\udd84","3348":"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs.","3349":"Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.","3350":"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines & tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as \u201cfacts\u201d by Reveal.","3351":"We\u2019re working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle\/squeak & pinpoint origin by acoustic signature & triangulation","3352":"SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to @NASA Plum Brook vacuum chamber pic.twitter.com\/BckUBkroLw","3353":"For sure before snowfall this year","3354":"It can tow far more than rated capacity","3355":"Exactly!

Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.","3358":"Exactly \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udf89! That will be really fun & shed light on what\u2019s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.","3359":"Yeah, \u201cReveal\u201d was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota\/GM was twice as high as today\u2019s non-union.","3360":"About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried & hourly, union & non-union were let go in annual review.

A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released.","3377":"What\u2019s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.","3378":"It\u2019s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage  https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/tesla-with-autopilot-slams-into-truck-stopped-at-red-light\/2018\/05\/12\/18d2e740-563e-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.7466cb626644\u00a0\u2026","3379":"Yes","3380":"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It\u2019s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla.
